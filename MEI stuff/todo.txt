Change how entropy is calculated:
    1st make the grid chunks bigger?
    2nd and more important, rather than calculate entropy of one image and then average over all
                                    do:
    get full pixel distribution for a chunk of all images, then do entropy calculation

check:
    that calculating entropy for 2d chunk and a 1d chunk, reshaped as 2d (x, 1) give the same value

    difference if I force the entropy range to be from 0-255 and just using the default entropy
    possibly using the largest range of each chunk

calculate the population RF:
    this includes lana and everything, get the contour and area mask. make mask slightly differently:
        layer area of each ellipse as an increase of 1, so it also conveys the density of the mask

    look at removing outliers, taking some confidence interval, as that is not really feasible maybe trim values below 5 or 10 etc...
    then normalise mask to be boolean?

check:
    the mask and contour is all correct, and using it to mask out images also works

calculate entropy of for each condition for the cRF using the mask, and the not cRF using the not mask area

as the cRF will be funny shaped, I need to convert this into a 1d array and then reshape it as (x, 1), so ensure shannon entropy gives the same value
